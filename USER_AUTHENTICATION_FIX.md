# 🔧 Doctor Calendar Management - User Authentication Fix

## ❌ Problem Identified
**Error:** "User not found" when accessing Doctor Calendar Management

**Root Cause:** The `UserProvider.currentUser` was returning `null`, indicating that the user session wasn't properly loaded when the calendar screen initialized.

## ✅ Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced User Loading in Calendar Screen**
- Added `_ensureUserAndLoadData()` method that:
  - Checks if user is loaded in UserProvider
  - Attempts to reload user data if missing
  - Provides detailed debugging information
  - Shows helpful error messages to the user

### 2. **Improved Error Handling**
- Added comprehensive logging to track user loading process
- Better error messages that guide users on next steps
- Retry functionality built into error notifications
- Shows UserProvider error details when available

### 3. **Initialization Updates**
- Modified `initState()` to use the new `_ensureUserAndLoadData()` method
- Updated refresh button to use the same robust loading approach
- Updated date picker to properly reload data when date changes

## 🚀 How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Launch the App
```bash
flutter run
```

### Step 2: Login as Doctor
1. Open the app
2. Login with a doctor account
3. Navigate to the doctor dashboard

### Step 3: Test Calendar Management
1. Click on "Manage Calendar" or similar navigation
2. Check the console output for debugging messages:
   - Should see: `🔍 Current user status:`
   - Should see: `✅ User loaded: [user_id] (doctor)`
   - Should see: `📅 Found X appointments for [date]`

### Step 4: If Error Occurs
1. Look for detailed error messages in console
2. Try the "Retry" button in the error notification
3. If still failing, try logging out and back in

## 🔍 Console Debugging Output

When working correctly, you should see:
```
🔍 Current user status:
  - UserProvider.currentUser: [user_uid]
  - UserProvider.isLoading: false
  - UserProvider.error: None
📱 Using user ID: [user_uid]
👨‍⚕️ User role: doctor
📅 Found X appointments for YYYY-MM-DD
⚡ Loaded availability: {09:00 AM: true, 10:00 AM: false, ...}
```

If there's an issue, you'll see:
```
🔍 Current user status:
  - UserProvider.currentUser: NULL
  - UserProvider.isLoading: false
  - UserProvider.error: [error_details]
🔄 No user found, loading current user...
```

## 🛠️ Additional Troubleshooting

### If the issue persists:

1. **Check Firebase Auth State**
   - Verify user is actually logged in to Firebase Auth
   - Check if session expired

2. **Clear App Data**
   - Sometimes cached authentication data can be corrupted
   - Try clearing app data or reinstalling

3. **Check Network Connection**
   - Ensure device can connect to Firebase services

4. **Verify User Document**
   - Check if the user document exists in Firestore `/users/{uid}`
   - Verify the user has role "doctor"
